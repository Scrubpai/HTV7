# Polyglot.io
An AI-powered video chatting platform for learning new languages

Used React.js, Node.js, AssemblyAI, Socket IO, WebRTC, Heroku

## Description
Polyglot is a video-chatting app that gamifies language-learning. You will be connected to someone in a call based on the language that you're fluent in, and the language that you want to learn. Much like Mad Libs, you will be given a quote (in the language you're learning) with a fill-in-the-blank noun, all of which you have to pronounce correctly (your Polyglot partner will help you!). Once you are done understanding the text, you will record and submit an audio clip of your pronunciation, and submit it to our server which tests the accuracy of your pronunciation using AssemblyAI.
